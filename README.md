QOSF Mentorship Program - Cohort 4 - Screening Test - Task 2

Problem statement :

Prepare random 4 4-qubit quantum states. Create and train a variational circuit that transforms input states into predefined output states. The predefined states are |0011>, |0101>, |1010>, |1100>. 

if random state $0$ encoded as $|0000>$, is provided, it returns state $|1100>$

if random state $1$ encoded as $|0001>$, is provided, it returns state $|0101>$

if random state $2$ encoded as $|0010>$, is provided, it returns state $|1010>$

if random state $3$ encoded as $|0011>$, is provided, it returns state $|0011>$

if any other random state is provided the code returns $|0000>$
